                <p>
                    Manchester United is one of the most successful football clubs, not only in football but also in social branding, awareness, and commercial ventures. From its humble beginnings to becoming a global powerhouse, the club has consistently demonstrated excellence both on and off the pitch, earning a loyal fanbase across the world.
                    The era of glory began in the late of 1990s, under the management of Sir Alex Ferguson and their most famous academic players, the 92 Class,  marked by the treble win trophies.
                    The club continued its dominance and began to fell into a period of transition after Ferguson's retirement in 2013. Despite managerial changes and challenges, Manchester United remained competitive, securing several domestic trophies and maintaining a strong presence in European competitions.
